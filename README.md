To whom this may concern

You will find a few personnal projects on which I have worked in my spare time over the years.
The projects are organized by language and each is presented in a README file.

Please note that these projects are not production-ready in any shape or form.
Only the project 'My Many Apps' is more mature in its design and could evolve into a 'usable' tool.

I am also currently working on the following trainings so the code is not original and not included in the repo

## On Coursera
### Scala (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)
  #### Functional Programming Principles in Scala ####
  #### Functional Program Design in Scala ####
  #### 3 upcoming courses to complete the certification ####

  ### 2 more courses to complete the certification
## On youtube channel The Cherno 
### The Hazel Game Engine series
